        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Ankit Patel, a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering (2023) and currently
            pursuing my MCA. I am passionate about software engineering, web development, and exploring new
            technologies. With hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy working on
            full-stack projects and creating impactful applications that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've completed a 45-day internship with Alphawizz Technologies, where I worked on both frontend (HTML, CSS,
            Bootstrap) and backend (PHP) projects, utilizing MySQL for database management. My aim is to continuously
            grow as a full-stack developer, and I'm especially interested in MERN stack development and AI-powered
            applications.
        </p>
